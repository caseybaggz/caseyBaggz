Known for their innovative ideas, Mindhandle was looking to showcase their creativity through a new responsive image-driven site. I developed the drop-down intro animation with GSAP by Greensock, created the custom pic/video slideshows using jQuery, &amp; built a custom framework using HTML5/SASS - optimized for modern browsers.</p> <a href="http://mindhandle.com/" target="_blank" class="blue siteLink">VISIT SITE</a> </div>
