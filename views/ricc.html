Since Riccione is a job placement company, I decided to go with a clean &amp; personal approach for the design. The bold usage of blue brings trust to the viewer, as well as people shots including real client testimonies. The main bar of content describes the history of the company with a call-to-action inviting the potential client to interact with the 3 main navigation links to choose from.</p> <a href="http://riccione.com/" target="_blank" class="blue siteLink">VISIT SITE</a> </div>
