<!-- Media Layer view --> <div class="soloWrapper clearfix" id="ml"> <img class="device" id="mlDevice" src="images/mLayerDevice.902c5ead.jpg" alt="media layer" width="787"> </div> <div class="whiteBox"> <h2 class="orange">Media Layer</h2> <p>Sister Technologies came to me with the problem of developing their successful Media Layer &amp; upgrading it to be responsive. I chose to create a footer to allow access for all the options, and medium-sized icons to control each within the layer itself. I accomplished this with HTML5 for the framework, SASS for responsiveness, &amp; Javascript/jQuery for the slideshow functionality.</p> </div>
