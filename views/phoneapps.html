I chose to utilize their mission statement by creating an intro splash screen &amp; a photo-driven form login to enhance the visual impact. Lastly, I used an accordion style list for the membership guidelines, so the user could easily understand what lies next in their membership registration. I developed the splash screen animation &amp; phone menu slide with GSAP, &amp; created animated tranisitons with CSS3.</p> </div>
