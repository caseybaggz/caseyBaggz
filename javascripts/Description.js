  lays: `<p>I had the priviledge to lead the front end for the latest Lays
  campaign called "The Passport to Flavor". The concept was to allow users to
  have a simple account where they would enter codes and receive "miles" to
  spend and stamps to add to their "passport" for a grand prize trip.</p> \

  <p>Keeping track of users accounts through Rails was a great way to start. From
  there I managed the front end utilizing a small helper toolbelt with Normalize,
  Animate.css, LoDash, and es6. Knowing I wanted some intricate view transitions
  and binding I decided to utilize the power of React to allow us the ability to
  create a web-component based app.</p> \

  <p>In the end product we used and customized the Slick Carousel for the main view
  and some nice transition tricks for the "multi-view" raffle/passport component.
  The bot has some advanced css animations utilizing css-masks to fake the material
  design ink effect for opening and closing it.</p> \

  <p>This was really fun to do and a great start to a new year of growth and
  challenge.</p>`,

  thrive: `<p>PROTOTYPE - Purely front-end this is a straight React app utilizing
  the goodness of es6. Built with static data for dev speed this is one of the
  cleanest React apps I've had the priviledge to build. There is still much room
  for growth regarding learning new stuff, but I'm pretty satisfied with
  this app.</p>

  <p>The tool suite is nothing major, just the basics. Although, this project was
  the first to allow me to start creating the "Baggz-kit" suite. I found that I
  was just using the same patterns in all my other projects, so from this one
  birthed the original Baggz-kit UI...kit. Made for Rails apps, it's a nice
  starting set-up with an index.html meta starting point along with Sass and JS
  inits. LoDash, Fetch Polyfill, Animate.css, and Normalize come built into the
  kit for a nice bonus too.</p>

  <p>From a technical standpoint, most of this app is inheriting prop types from
  parents and utilizing the power of Animate.css and vanilla scroll events to
  do some nice little magic with the scroll button. This was a crazy fun idea to
  have the opportunity to build and get a better feel for React.</p>`
